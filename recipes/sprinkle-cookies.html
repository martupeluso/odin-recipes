        <li>Use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment to cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time and vanilla until just combined. Scrape the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until <em>almost</em> combined. Then add the sprinkles and keep mixing. <strong>Do not over-mix the dough!</strong></li>
        <li>Using a 3 tbsp cookie scoop, scoop dough onto lined baking sheets. Be sure to adjust the baking time if your cookies are smaller/larger.</li>
        <li>Bake sprinkle cookies for 14 minutes then cool on the baking sheet. The cookies will continue to bake as they cool. If desired, press candy eyeballs into warm cookies.</li>
